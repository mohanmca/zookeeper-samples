This is code that accompanies a talk I gave on Apache ZooKeeper.

The slides can be found at http://www.slideshare.net/scottleber/apache-zookeeper

May 2017 Update:
* Updated ZooKeeper version to 3.4.10
* Updated Curator version to 2.12.0
* Changed all System.out to SLFJ Loggers
* A bunch of misc. code cleanup, e.g. converting anonymous inner classes to lambdas, using diamond operator, etc.
